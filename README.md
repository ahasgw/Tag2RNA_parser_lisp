# TAG2RNA parser (CL)

These code fragments are studies I created in the mid-1990s for an RNA secondary structure prediction program. At the time, I was truly fascinated by the extreme flexibility of Common Lisp, and I wrote the code as I was learning it.
Recently I found them among my old backups. I decided to upload them as they are.
